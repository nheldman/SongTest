# SongTest API

## Summary

[SongTest](http://50pop.com/songtest) is an idea for a free, open song contest by [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org).

This site hosts a modified implementation of the RESTful API Derek defined, developed by [Noah Heldman](mailto:noah.heldman@gmail.com), using Sinatra, DataMapper, and RSpec.

This is a work-in-progress, and eventually, this page will contain Getting Started and API documentation.
